Hi, I'm An🌽.

I graduated with honors from the Mechanical Engineering program at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (2020-2024). Currently, I am delving into the fundamentals of control theory and optimal control theory 🔬.

I am actively seeking for higher education opportunity in the fields of robotics, mechatronics, biomechanics, ...

I love travel 🚊 and sport 🏊, I also enjoy cooking 🍜 and have a great passion for learning 📝.

Feel free to contact me anytime by [email](an0906946088@gmail.com)!
