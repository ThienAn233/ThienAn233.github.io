Hi, I'm An🌽.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in [Mechatronic Systems and Robotics](https://www.nmt.edu/academics/mecheng/graduate-1.php) at [New Mexico Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Institute_of_Mining_and_Technology) (2024-Now).

I graduated with honors from the [Mechanical Engineering program](https://fme.hcmut.edu.vn/) at [HCMUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City_University_of_Technology) (2021-2024).

My interests include the fundamentals of control theory, dynamical systems, and data-driven modelling  🔬.

I love wandering 🚊, playing sports 🏊. I also enjoy cooking 🍜 and have a great passion for learning 📝.

Feel free to contact me anytime by [email](an0906946088@gmail.com)!
