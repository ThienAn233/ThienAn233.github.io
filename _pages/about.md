Hi, I'm An🌽.

I graduated with honors from the [Mechanical Engineering program](https://fme.hcmut.edu.vn/) at [HCMUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City_University_of_Technology) (2021-2024). Currently, I am delving into the fundamentals of control theory and optimal control 🔬.

I am actively seeking for higher education opportunity in the fields of robotics, mechatronics, biomechanics, ...

I love wandering 🚊, playing sports 🏊. I also enjoy cooking 🍜 and have a great passion for learning 📝.

Feel free to contact me anytime by [email](an0906946088@gmail.com)!
