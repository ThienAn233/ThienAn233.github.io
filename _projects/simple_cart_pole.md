The purpose of this project is to create an environment that simulates the cart-pole dynamic system. The original problem is related to the [inverted pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum), which consists of a pendulum with its center of mass above its pivot point and a cart that moves the pendulum horizontally. This system is unstable and falls over without additional help. The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in **dynamics** and **control** theory and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies. It is often implemented with the pivot point mounted on a cart that can move horizontally under control.
